# Advice for Behavioural questions
Your answers should have numbers, complexity , details on 
situation in terms of what was the problem, stakeholders involved, conversations that happened,
metrics measured KPIs. The step wise problem , resolution and impact should come out. 
Don't stretch too much in beginning but be prepared this much in follow up questions.

# General Internet Advice
    Make at least 15-20 STAR format stories. 
    Match LPs to stories, not the other way around. 
    One story can be associated with multiple LPs.  

    Share personal experiences and work experiences and really elaborate how 
    you managed changed and how it affected you as a leader. 

    you can ask for a quicker re-apply cool down, if your interview resaults 
    were borderline

    Make the interviewer understand **WHY** the situation was problematic
    and **HOW** the task was challenging
    Always have a description as to why that problem won't happen again

    focus these: deep dive, disagree and commit, invent and simplify
